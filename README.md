# Executive Hangar Timer Discord Bot

A Discord bot that monitors the executive hangar timer at Xyxyll's site and sends timely notifications to a Discord channel.

## Features

- **30-minute warning system**: Automatically warns users when the hangar is about to open
- **Smart role mentions**: Mentions `@exec-pings` role only during active hours (11am-9pm AEST)
- **Quiet hours**: No role pings during 9pm-11am AEST (still posts warnings without mentions)
- **Slash commands**: `/hangar` and `/hanger` commands to query current timer status with 1-minute cooldown
- **Discord timestamps**: Times display in each user's local timezone automatically
- **Duplicate prevention**: Avoids multiple announcements for the same opening window
- **Health check endpoint**: Built-in HTTP health check for monitoring and deployment
- **Configurable thresholds**: Customizable warning time and polling frequency

## Health Check

The bot includes a built-in health check endpoint at `/health` (or `/`) that returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "bot": "SCANZ EXEC BOT#8213",
  "uptime": "2h 15m 30s",
  "lastSuccessfulFetch": "45s ago",
  "cachedEntries": 24,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T02:07:40.146Z"
}
```

This is useful for monitoring the bot's health and ensuring it's fetching schedules correctly.
